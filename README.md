This project is a advent calender from scratch. It's my own idea and I implemented some small features. 
List of features- 
- opening doors (1 to 24)
- countdown
- gifts as specific food
-> repice button also featured with ingridients

This is my second html project and my first js project, so it's not optimized and a bit squeezed on especially mobile devices. 
Anyway, have fun and test it out.
